# Administrative Stuff

There are two areas of "Administrative" stuff that need to be considered.

## Contributors and Maintainers

I think it is best if we leave this open and allow PRs from anyone, but who will review them, approve them, etc.?

### How do I contribute?

1. Log in to Github.
2. Navigate to the [maglev-training.github.io](https://github.com/maglev-training/maglev-training.github.io) repository.
3. Fork the repository. This will create a copy of the maglev repo on your github account.
4. Return to your github account and clone the newly forked repository to your local machine.
5. Make your code changes locally, and push them up to your remote repository.
6. When you are ready to merge your changes with the main repository, return to the forked repository page on your github profile and click the pull request button.
7. Ensure that the source and target repositories are what you expect, and create the pull request.

At this point, contributors and maintainers will review your pull request. Once all discussions and changes have been made, the code will be merged into the main repo branch.

## The "Infrastructure" Side

The hosting of the application, tokens for building and pulling containers, etc. all needs to be kept private. I'd like to document it though, because that is a huge stumbling block for a lot of people getting going.
